A finished app was presented to be updated with the following.
* Update CSS to work with different media types (screen sizes etc)
* Amend for accessibility
* Add a service worker for offline functionality

## Leaflet.js and Mapbox:
This project uses Leaflet.js and the Mapbox API. A free key for [Mapbox] was acquired from (https://www.mapbox.com/).

### Note about ES6

Most of the code in this project has been written to the ES6 JavaScript specification for compatibility with modern web browsers and future proofing JavaScript code.

### Using this project

If you wish to view the project and restaurant app for yourself you may
download all source files from this github profile. You will then need to setup a python server using a source-shell such as git.

Simply run a local python server (https://www.python.org/) and go to localhost:8000 in your browser, Google Chrome Canary (https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/canary.html) is recommended for service worker compatibility.
